  A true-color image of the moon captured just shy of 16 days into the lunar month. The moon is illuminated at 98.6% - about 25 hours past full.

Images of the Moon in color seem to have become quite popular in the past few years. Done correctly, the coloring isn't the result of a graphic designers wet dream though PS is involved a little. The colors are true. 

Saturation and vibrance levels may be altered a bit depending on personal taste. I didn't quite push it as far as other images I have seen recently. I also did not stick with subtle. 

This particular image was captured with a Canon EOS 60D at 100 iso. The exposure length was 1/250 seconds. One single exposure was used. Captured was obtained using BackyardEOS. The telescope was an AT8RC with a CCDT67 set at 1200mm (default is 1625mm) for a speed of f/5.9.

Areas of the lunar surface lit up in blue contain high concentrations of titanium where orange and purple reveal low levels of titanium and iron.

I found the most peculiar structure of this image to be the Aristarchus plateau on the northwest face - the area that looks like a trapezoidal-like artifact. In fact, I thought I had erred in processing the image. However, the entire area is a real feature containing several other small craters and rilles and shows in most other images of the region.

The area has been subject to numerous observations of an event called "transient lunar phenomenon", or TLP. TLP isn't quite understood as of yet. It is a quick event that gives a sudden change to the level of light or color to a region. According to [Chronological Catalog of Reported Lunar Events](http://www.astrosurf.com/lunascan/papers/R-277.pdf) and [Analyses of Lunar Transient Phenomena (LTP) Observations from 557-1994 A.D.](http://users.aber.ac.uk/atc/tlp/cameron.pdf), the Aristarchus Plateau accounts for nearly 1/3 of thousands of observations of the phenomenon.

The earliest known event was by a German astronomer named Hermann Joseph Klein in 1881. Most recently the crew of Apollo 11 was asked to record observations based on reports NASA had received recently. To which Command Module Pilot Michael Collins replied, 

{{< blockquote author="Michael Collins" source="Time Magazine" title="A GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND">}}Hey, Houston, I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence.{{< /blockquote >}}

{{< figure src="copernicus.png" alt="Copernicus" title="Copernicus" class="rounded mx-auto d-block text-center" caption="Copernicus and it's rays spreading for more than 500 miles from the center." >}}

The crater Copernicus is one of the most recognizable features of the Moon. Admittedly, the capture above doesn't quite do justice to the depth of the crater - just over 2 1/4 miles or twice the depth of the Grand Canyon but similar to Aristarchus. It is 58 miles at it's widest point. Visible in the center of the crater are three mountainous rises approximately 3/4-miles above the crater floor. 

Eratosthenes is a 35-mile wide crater to the northwest of Copernicus. 

{{< figure src="mare-serenitatis.png" alt="Mare Serenitatis" title="Mare Serenitatis" class="rounded mx-auto d-block text-center" caption="One of the \"eyes\" of the moon, Mare Serenitatis, shows a beautiful color gradient of purples, oranges, and blues." >}}

Mare Serenitatis helps demonstrate the color gradients captured in the image. The mare is also the site of a positive gravitational anomaly known as "mascon". It is approximately 419 miles at it's widest. Mare Serenitatis is also one of the eyes of the "man in the moon" phenomena (which I still can't see to this day so I think ya'll that do see it are high).

Mare Serenitatis is filled with several small pot-marks of blasts; the largest of which is the crater Bessel - lower-center - at ten miles wide. The smallest of which I can verify is Bessel H located north-northeast of Bessel (follow the light-shaded crater ray to the first pair of craters). It has a radius of approximately 2 miles.

Posidonius (upper-right) and the bright coloring of Aristillus (top-left) are also noted in this image.
