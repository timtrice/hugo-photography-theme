First light of my rig set at my tiny little observatory at Stellar skies in Pontotoc Texas!

I got a small observatory closer to Austin that is accessible (it is under 2 hours from my house). After months of dragging my feet, I finally set up the system over at the observatory. I am starting with a widefield setup and hope to get to 2+ m at somepoint.

There are few things that still need to be worked out - Roof control is still manual and it is a bit unnerving not to have automatic closing of roof in case of bad weather :)

There is still work to be done tuning the CTU to fix tilt but it is manageable.

I absolutely love dusty targets in broadband and most of my widefield images are from my backyard in Austin and I could only manage narrowband. So my first target is in the Perseus region with its tons of interesting targets. NGC1333 has always been very interesting and I went after it with 10 minute subs. The result has been delightfully dusty! I really like how this turned out.

This has been processed in Pixinsight and finished in Photoshop.
